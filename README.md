# Hi, I’m Dinesh Kyanam 👋

**Data Engineer** focused on real-time streaming, scalable data platforms, and cloud-native ETL/ELT.

- 🔭 **Current:** Building and optimizing **real-time retail data pipelines** at Walgreens (Snowflake + Delta Lake on AWS; Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming; Airflow; sub-second analytics).
- 🏥 **Before:** At TCS, engineered **healthcare data pipelines** (500GB+/day), automated compliance reporting, and improved warehouse performance.
- 📊 **Early:** Capgemini—optimized Hadoop/Hive + PySpark jobs and delivered faster BI dashboards.
- 🎓 **M.S. Computer Science** — University of Central Missouri
- 🌱 Sharpening: PySpark performance tuning, Lakehouse patterns, cost-efficient batch/stream design
- 🤝 Open to collaborate on **Python-based data engineering** and **open-source** infra/tooling

## 🧩 Featured Projects
> I’m curating and pushing clean, reproducible repos for these (infra-as-code + sample data + notebooks). Pin them once live.

- **Real-Time Retail Analytics Platform**  
  Kafka → Spark Structured Streaming → Delta Lake/Snowflake → Airflow → Dash/Streamlit for near-real-time KPIs.  
  *Focus:* exactly-once semantics, schema evolution, SCD, cost controls.

- **Healthcare Data Integration & Compliance**  
  Batch/stream ingestion of HL7/JSON/CSV → validation → PII handling → curated zones → automated compliance reports.  
  *Focus:* data quality checks, lineage, audit readiness.

- **PySpark Performance Playbook**  
  Notebook examples of partitioning, AQE, broadcast joins, Z-order/clustered tables, cache/persist strategies.  
  *Focus:* before/after benchmarks and memory profiles.

> Want code now? Ping me—I can prioritize and publish the repo you need first.
